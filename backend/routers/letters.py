Re: Request for Fee Schedule Rate Review and Adjustment
Provider: {CLINIC_NAME}
NPI (Group): {CLINIC_NPI2}  |  EIN: {CLINIC_EIN}  |  Contract/Provider ID: {pid}

To the Provider Relations / Contracting Team at {payer_name}:

My name is {CLINIC_CONTACT}, and I am writing on behalf of {CLINIC_NAME}, a
psychiatric telehealth practice located in Windermere, Florida. We are currently
credentialed with {payer_name} under the above contract and have been proud to
serve your members with high-quality, accessible behavioral health care.

As part of our ongoing commitment to financial sustainability and continued network
participation, we are formally requesting a review and upward adjustment of our
current reimbursement rates for psychiatric services.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY WE ARE REQUESTING A RATE ADJUSTMENT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Behavioral health services are experiencing significant cost pressures including
rising overhead, workforce shortages, and increased clinical complexity among
patients. Our current contracted rates under {payer_name} fall below our target
benchmark of 130% of the 2026 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule — a standard
commonly used to ensure financial viability for specialty practices.

A review of our current fee schedule reveals that the majority of our most
frequently billed psychiatric CPT codes are reimbursed at rates materially below
this benchmark, representing an estimated annual revenue gap of approximately
{total_gap_fmt} for our practice.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
REQUESTED RATE ADJUSTMENTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The following table summarizes our highest-priority codes, the current contracted
rate, our requested target rate (130% of 2026 Medicare), and the per-unit gap:

{table}

Our target rates are based on 130% of the 2026 CMS Medicare Physician Fee
Schedule (non-facility, FL locality), which reflects the minimum threshold
necessary to sustain quality psychiatric care delivery.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ABOUT SOLREI BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

  • All providers: PMHNP-BC certified

  • Specialties: Medication management, psychiatric evaluation, supportive therapy

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
REQUESTED NEXT STEPS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

We respectfully request:

  1. A formal review of our current fee schedule rates for the CPT codes listed
     above, with consideration of adjustment to 130% of the 2026 Medicare PFS.

  2. A meeting or call with your contracting team to discuss this request and
     explore a mutually agreeable rate amendment.

  3. A written response within 30 days outlining {payer_name}'s position and
     any proposed revised rates.

Please direct all correspondence regarding this matter to:

  {CLINIC_CONTACT}
  {CLINIC_NAME}
